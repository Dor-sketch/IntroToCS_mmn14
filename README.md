# 📚 Java Introductory Algorithms (Ex14)

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains a collection of basic algorithms written in Java, primarily derived from the coursework of the "20441 Introduction to Computer Science" class that I studied at the Open University of Israel in 2019b. I primarily work in C, C++, and Python, but this project is a testament to my foundational skills in Java.

## 🏆 Achievements

- Successfully completed the course with a grade of 90.

## 📋 Algorithms Covered

1. **💧 Water Volume Calculation**: Determines the trapped water volume between barriers based on their heights.
2. **📈 Longest Subsequence**: Finds the longest subsequence with an even sum in an array.
3. **🧮 Solution Finder**: Computes how many ways three numbers (between 1 and 10) can sum up to a given number.
4. **🗺️ Path Sum in Matrix**: Determines if a path exists in a matrix that sums up to a given number.

## 🌟 Features

- Utilizes both iterative and recursive approaches.
- Employs a wide range of data structures like arrays and matrices.
- Offers an interactive testing suite for the "Path Sum in Matrix" algorithm.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repository and compile `Ex14.java`:

```java
javac Ex14.java
